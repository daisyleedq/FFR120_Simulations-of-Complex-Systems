#cuda-deep-neural-net-0.1.1
=====================
##UNFINISHED
Deep neural network framework (C/C++/CUDA).

To run this code, you should have 
* a cifar-10 dataset( put "cifar-10-batches-bin" where this .md file is, you can get it from [HERE](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), make sure to download the binary version which suitable for C programs);
* nVidia graphic card which supports nVidia CUDA
* for running network with pre-trained network, you should put pre-trained files into "config" folder, there is a demo config folder which is named "pre-trained-conf", you can rename it to "config" and replace the current "config" folder.

##Compile & Run
add this project into nVidia nsight, add **curand** and **cufft** into path. 

##Updates 
* 0.1.0: Aug.5, the first version released.
* 0.1.1: Aug.10, remove hostData in Mat, only use device memory, for speed up.
* 0.1.1: Aug.11, add functions that save matrices and configs into .txt files.
* 0.1.1: Aug.12, add functions that read network from .txt files.

##Data Structures
####Mat
* Similar with Mat in OpenCV, has memory in both CPU and GPU, use it to do most of the calculations.

####cpuMat
* Has memory only in CPU, use it to read dataset, and do pre-processing (unless your GPU memory is huge...).

####vector3f
* Similar with Scalar in OpenCV, has 3 float space, which corresponses 3 channels. For example, the sum of a 3-channal Mat is a vector3f.

####vector2i
* Similar with vector3f, but has 2 int space, use it to represent 2-d position, or size. 

##Layer Config Description 
* For each layer, there is a **layer_name**, a **layer_type**, and a **output_format**.
* There are currently 2 output formats: **matrix** single channel Mat, and **image** (vector of 3-channel Mat).

####Input Layer
* **batch size**: the training process is using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.

####Convolutional Layer
* **kernel size**: size of kernels for convolution calculation.
* **kernel amount**: amount of kernels for convolution calculation.
* **combine map**: amount of combine feature map, details can be found in [Notes on Convolutional Neural Networks](http://cogprints.org/5869/1/cnn_tutorial.pdf).
* **weight decay**: weight decay for convolutional kernels.
* **padding**: padding before doing convolution.
* **stride**: stride when doing convolution (For "VALID" type of convolution, **result size = (image_size + 2 * padding - kernel_size) / stride + 1)**.

####Fully Connected Layer
* **num hidden neurons**: size of fully connected layer.
* **weight decay**: weight decay for fully connected layer.

####Softmax Layer
* **num classes**: output size of softmax layer.
* **weight decay**: weight decay for softmax layer.

####Non-linearity Layer
* **method**: sigmoid/tanh/relu/leaky_relu.

####Pooling Layer
* **method**: max/mean/stochastic.
* **overlap**: if use overlap pooling.
* **window size**: window size when using overlap pooling.
* **stride**: pooling stride.

####Local Response Normalization Layer
* **alpha**, **beta**, **k**, **n**: see [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf).

####Dropout Layer
* **dropout rate**: percentage of zeros when generating Bernoulli matrix.

####Combine Layer
* for implementing GoogLeNet, TODO...

####Branch Layer
* for implementing GoogLeNet, TODO...

##Structure and Algorithm
See my several posts about CNNs at [my tech-blog](http://eric-yuan.me).

##CPU Version
[There's also a CPU version of this code which I used OpenCV as the linear algebra library.](https://github.com/xingdi-eric-yuan/conv-net-version-3).

##TODO
* combine layer
* branch layer
* stochastic pooling
